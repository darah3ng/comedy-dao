# Comedy DAO üé≠

DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization

A platform where people receive $*COMEDY* whenever they share their funniest jokes. The community gets to vote on what joke is best, and the winner gets rewarded with *$COMEDY*.

## Contracts

[ERC-1155](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x4BbB42D171858Ea5025A18CC22ac65759384C42A)
- With an ERC-1155, multiple people can be the holder of the same NFT. In this case, our "membership NFT" is the same for everyone, so instead of making a new NFT every time we can simply assign the same NFT to all our members. This is also more gas efficient! This is a pretty common approach for cases where the NFT is the same for all holders.

[ERC-20](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x6fc5c8a826b216df26cb90e0da9e3cf2cf988e8e)
- This acts as a governance token which means that users who hold this token can vote on proposals.


[Governance contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x97182d6581b206ed74A54239B03B93F5E29F7C72)
